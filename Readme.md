# SuperTinyEngine

A little Engine made with [Fable](http://fsprojects.github.io/Fable/)

## Active Development

Please note that this library is at is early stage and under active development. You will certainly encounter some bugs, rought edges and pain points.

Issues, feedbacks and suggestions are welcome.

Thanks, Shadaen.

### Why SuperTinyEngine ?

You can ask, why another engine and not use Fable with an existing Javascript engine.

It's simple, I don't really like how the others engines are working and I want
to build this engine in a functionnal way. To take benefit of F#.

Hidden goals:

- Show that Fable is mature enought
- Push the canvas to it's limit and show that it can be enought to write games.

### Philosophy

Actually, I just implement the functionality following a naive way.

And everything, in the project should be documented to simplify the learning curve.

## Getting Started
